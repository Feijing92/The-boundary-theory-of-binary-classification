# The-boundary-theory-of-binary-classification
This repository provides a method to calculate upper performance bounds and lower loss bounds for binary classification problems using data structures. The approach presented here is useful in evaluating the termination criteria for the training process and achieving a balance between overfitting and generalization performance.
